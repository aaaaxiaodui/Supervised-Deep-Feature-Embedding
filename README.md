# Supervised-Deep-Feature-Embedding
This code is to produce the T-SNE visualization of the deep feature embeddings. Mainly for the paper "Supervised Deep Feature Embedding with Hand Crafted Feature" based on the Stanford Online Products test dataset and the In-shop Clothes Retrieval test dataset.

After our paper is accepted, we will keep updating and release more detailed code, all feature embeddings for test datasets used to this paper and all trained models by our methods.
