# Supervised-Deep-Feature-Embedding
## Introduction
This code is to produce the t-SNE visualization of the deep feature embeddings. Mainly for the paper "Supervised Deep Feature Embedding with Hand Crafted Feature" based on the Stanford Online Products test dataset and the In-shop Clothes Retrieval test dataset.

After our paper is accepted, we will keep updating and release more detailed code. All feature embeddings of test datasets and all trained models by our methods will be released soon.

## Installiation
1. Install python 2.7 in ubuntu (we test in this platform)
2. Install or upgrade sklearn by the commond "sudo pip install -U scikit-learn"

## Prerequisites
2. Download datasets according to the links that are given in the data folder
3. Download feature embeddings according to the links that are given in the embeddings folder
